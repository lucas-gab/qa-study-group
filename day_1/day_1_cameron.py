# Variables and Math Operations

# Declare tw variables that store numbers and print() a sum, a subtraction and division and a multiplication
# Your code below this line

a = 100
b = 10

print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a / b)
print(a * b)

# Data Types
# Create a String
message_1 = "I'm "
message_2 = "rolling with the homies"
# Create an Int
myInt = 5
# Create a Flaot
myFloat = 5.5
# Print two strings being concatenated
print(message_1 + message_2)
# Print two numbers being multiplied
print(myInt * myFloat)
# Print a string being multiplied
print(message_2 * myInt)

# List Data Type
# Make a list with 5 names
myList = ["Lucas", "Cameron", "Let", "Andrew", "Edu"]
# print the second and the fifth name of your list
print(myList[1])
print(myList[4])

# Make a list with a range from 1 to 20
myRange = [*range(1, 20)]
# Print the range list
print(myRange)

# Declare a variable my_name and assign a string to it with your name
myName = "Cameron"
# Write your name with funky captalization like lUcAs
# print my_name on lowercase only (use .lower())
# print my_name on uppercase only (use .upper())
# print my_name correctly captalized (use .capitalize())

# Declare a new variable called copy_qa_study_group and assign a copy of the first list to it and print the result (use .copy())
# Sort the original list and print the result (use .sort())
# Print the length of the list to see how many students are in it (use len())
# Clear the list and print out the result (use .clear())
